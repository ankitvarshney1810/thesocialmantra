A gram of soil can contain billions of organisms, belonging to thousands of species, mostly microbial and in the main still unexplored.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-21\">[21]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-22\">[22]</a> Soil has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean\">mean</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote\">prokaryotic</a> density of roughly 108 organisms per gram,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-23\">[23]</a> whereas the ocean has no more than 107 procaryotic organisms per milliliter (gram) of seawater.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-24\">[24]</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter\">Organic carbon</a> held in soil is eventually returned to the atmosphere through the process of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration\">respiration</a> carried out by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotrophic\">heterotrophic</a> organisms, but a substantial part is retained in the soil in the form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter\">soil organic matter</a>; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillage\">tillage</a> usually increases the rate of soil respiration, leading to the depletion of soil organic matter.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-25\">[25]</a> Since plant roots need oxygen, ventilation is an important characteristic of soil. This ventilation can be accomplished via networks of interconnected <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pore_space_in_soil\">soil pores</a>, which also absorb and hold rainwater making it readily available for uptake by plants. Since plants require a nearly continuous supply of water, but most regions receive sporadic rainfall, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_water_(retention)\">water-holding capacity</a> of soils is vital for plant survival.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-26\">[26]</a></p><p>Soils can effectively remove impurities,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-27\">[27]</a> kill disease agents,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-28\">[28]</a> and degrade contaminants, this latter property being called natural attenuation.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-29\">[29]</a> Typically, soils maintain a net absorption of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen\">oxygen</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane\">methane</a> and undergo a net release of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide\">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide\">nitrous oxide</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-30\">[30]</a> Soils offer plants physical support, air, water, temperature moderation, nutrients, and protection from toxins.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-31\">[31]</a> Soils provide readily available nutrients to plants and animals by converting dead organic matter into various nutrient forms.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-32\">[32]</a></p><h3><strong>Description[</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soil&action=edit&section=3\"><strong>edit</strong></a><strong>]</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Components of a loam soil by percent volume</p><p> Water (25%)</p><p> Gases (25%)</p><p> Sand (18%)</p><p> Silt (18%)</p><p> Clay (9%)</p><p> Organic matter (5%)</p><p>A typical soil is about 50% solids (45% mineral and 5% organic matter), and 50% voids (or pores) of which half is occupied by water and half by gas.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-McClellan2017-33\">[33]</a> The percent soil mineral and organic content can be treated as a constant (in the short term), while the percent soil water and gas content is considered highly variable whereby a rise in one is simultaneously balanced by a reduction in the other.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-34\">[34]</a> The pore space allows for the infiltration and movement of air and water, both of which are critical for life existing in soil.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-Vannier1987-35\">[35]</a> Compaction, a common problem with soils, reduces this space, preventing air and water from reaching plant roots and soil organisms.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-36\">[36]</a></p><p>Given sufficient time, an undifferentiated soil will evolve a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_horizon\">soil profile</a> which consists of two or more layers, referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_horizon\">soil horizons</a>, that differ in one or more properties such as in their texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and reactivity.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-Buol-10\">[10]</a> The horizons differ greatly in thickness and generally lack sharp boundaries; their development is dependent on the type of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent_material\">parent material</a>, the processes that modify those parent materials, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#soil-forming_factors\">soil-forming factors</a> that influence those processes. The biological influences on soil properties are strongest near the surface, while the geochemical influences on soil properties increase with depth. Mature soil profiles typically include three basic master horizons: A, B, and C. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solum\">solum</a> normally includes the A and B horizons. The living component of the soil is largely confined to the solum, and is generally more prominent in the A horizon.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTESimonson195717-37\">[37]</a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_texture\">soil texture</a> is determined by the relative proportions of the individual particles of sand, silt, and clay that make up the soil. The interaction of the individual mineral particles with organic matter, water, gases via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotic_component\">biotic</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiotic\">abiotic</a> processes causes those particles to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocculate\">flocculate</a> (stick together) to form <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_structure\">aggregates</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ped\">peds</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-Bronick2005-38\">[38]</a> Where these aggregates can be identified, a soil can be said to be developed, and can be described further in terms of color, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity\">porosity</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency\">consistency</a>, reaction (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidity\">acidity</a>), etc.</p><p>Water is a critical agent in soil development due to its involvement in the dissolution, precipitation, erosion, transport, and deposition of the materials of which a soil is composed.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-39\">[39]</a> The mixture of water and dissolved or suspended materials that occupy the soil <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pore_space\">pore space</a> is called the soil solution. Since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#Water\">soil water</a> is never pure water, but contains hundreds of dissolved organic and mineral substances, it may be more accurately called the soil solution. Water is central to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_(chemistry)\">dissolution</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)\">precipitation</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaching_(agriculture)\">leaching</a> of minerals from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_profile\">soil profile</a>. Finally, water affects the type of vegetation that grows in a soil, which in turn affects the development of the soil, a complex feedback which is exemplified in the dynamics of banded vegetation patterns in semi-arid regions.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-40\">[40]</a></p><p>Soils supply plants with nutrients, most of which are held in place by particles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_texture#Soil_separates\">clay</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter\">organic matter</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid\">colloids</a>)<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-41\">[41]</a> The nutrients may be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption\">adsorbed</a> on clay mineral surfaces, bound within clay minerals (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(chemistry)\">absorbed</a>), or bound within organic compounds as part of the living <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organism\">organisms</a> or dead <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter\">soil organic matter</a>. These bound nutrients interact with soil water to buffer the soil solution composition (attenuate changes in the soil solution) as soils wet up or dry out, as plants take up nutrients, as salts are leached, or as acids or alkalis are added.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-42\">[42]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-CEC-43\">[43]</a></p><p>Plant nutrient availability is affected by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_pH\">soil pH</a>, which is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in the soil solution. Soil pH is a function of many soil forming factors, and is generally lower (more acid) where weathering is more advanced.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-44\">[44]</a></p><p>Most plant nutrients, with the exception of nitrogen, originate from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral\">minerals</a> that make up the soil parent material. Some nitrogen originates from rain as dilute <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid\">nitric acid</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia\">ammonia</a>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-45\">[45]</a> but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation\">nitrogen fixation</a> by bacteria. Once in the soil-plant system, most nutrients are recycled through living organisms, plant and microbial residues (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter\">soil organic matter</a>), mineral-bound forms, and the soil solution. Both living <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_microbe\">microorganisms</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter\">soil organic matter</a> are of critical importance to this recycling, and thereby to soil formation and soil fertility.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-46\">[46]</a> Microbial activity in soils may release nutrients from minerals or organic matter for use by plants and other microorganisms, sequester (incorporate) them into living cells, or cause their loss from the soil by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatilisation\">volatilisation</a> (loss to the atmosphere as gases) or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaching_(agriculture)\">leaching</a>.</p><h2>History of studies[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soil&action=edit&section=4\">edit</a>]</h2><h3><strong>Fertility[</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soil&action=edit&section=5\"><strong>edit</strong></a><strong>]</strong></h3><p>The history of the study of soil is intimately tied to humans\' urgent need to provide food for themselves and forage for their animals. Throughout history, civilizations have prospered or declined as a function of the availability and productivity of their soils.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-47\">[47]</a></p><p>The Greek historian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon\">Xenophon</a> (450–355 BCE) is credited with being the first to expound upon the merits of green-manuring crops: \"But then whatever weeds are upon the ground, being turned into earth, enrich the soil as much as dung.\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDonahueMillerShickluna19774-48\">[48]</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columella\">Columella</a>\'s \"Husbandry,\" circa 60 CE, advocated the use of lime and that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover\">clover</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa\">alfalfa</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_manure\">green manure</a>) should be turned under, and was used by 15 generations (450 years) under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire\">Roman Empire</a> until its collapse.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDonahueMillerShickluna19774-48\">[48]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellogg19571-49\">[49]</a> From the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Rome\">fall of Rome</a> to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution\">French Revolution</a>, knowledge of soil and agriculture was passed on from parent to child and as a result, crop yields were low. During the European <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages\">Middle Ages</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-\'Awwam\">Yahya Ibn al-\'Awwam</a>\'s handbook,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-50\">[50]</a> with its emphasis on irrigation, guided the people of North Africa, Spain and the Middle East; a translation of this work was finally carried to the southwest of the United States when under Spanish influence.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-51\">[51]</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_de_Serres\">Olivier de Serres</a>, considered as the father of French <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agronomy\">agronomy</a>, was the first to suggest the abandonment of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallowing\">fallowing</a> and its replacement by hay <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadows\">meadows</a> within <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_rotation\">crop rotations</a>, and he highlighted the importance of soil (the French <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terroir\">terroir</a>) in the management of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard\">vineyards</a>. His famous book <i>Le Théâtre d’Agriculture et mesnage des champs</i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-52\">[52]</a> contributed to the rise of modern, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture\">sustainable agriculture</a> and to the collapse of old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_practices\">agricultural practices</a> such as the lifting of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_litter\">forest litter</a> for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment\">amendment</a> of crops (the French <i>soutrage</i>) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assarting\">assarting</a>, which ruined the soils of western Europe during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages\">Middle Ages</a> and even later on according to regions.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-53\">[53]</a></p><p>Experiments into what made plants grow first led to the idea that the ash left behind when plant matter was burned was the essential element but overlooked the role of nitrogen, which is not left on the ground after combustion, a belief which prevailed until the 19th century.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-54\">[54]</a> In about 1635, the Flemish chemist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Baptist_van_Helmont\">Jan Baptist van Helmont</a> thought he had proved water to be the essential element from his famous five years\' experiment with a willow tree grown with only the addition of rainwater. His conclusion came from the fact that the increase in the plant\'s weight had apparently been produced only by the addition of water, with no reduction in the soil\'s weight.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-Brady-55\">[55]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellogg19573-56\">[56]</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woodward_(naturalist)\">John Woodward</a> (d. 1728) experimented with various types of water ranging from clean to muddy and found muddy water the best, and so he concluded that earthy matter was the essential element. Others concluded it was humus in the soil that passed some essence to the growing plant. Still others held that the vital growth principal was something passed from dead plants or animals to the new plants. At the start of the 18th century, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethro_Tull_(agriculturist)\">Jethro Tull</a> demonstrated that it was beneficial to cultivate (stir) the soil, but his opinion that the stirring made the fine parts of soil available for plant absorption was erroneous.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-Brady-55\">[55]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellogg19572-57\">[57]</a></p><p>As chemistry developed, it was applied to the investigation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_fertility\">soil fertility</a>. The French chemist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier\">Antoine Lavoisier</a> showed in about 1778 that plants and animals must [combust] oxygen internally to live and was able to deduce that most of the 165-pound weight of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Baptist_van_Helmont\">van Helmont</a>\'s willow tree derived from air.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-58\">[58]</a> It was the French agriculturalist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Boussingault\">Jean-Baptiste Boussingault</a> who by means of experimentation obtained evidence showing that the main sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for plants were air and water, while nitrogen was taken from soil.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-59\">[59]</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_von_Liebig\">Justus von Liebig</a> in his book <i>Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology</i> (published 1840), asserted that the chemicals in plants must have come from the soil and air and that to maintain soil fertility, the used minerals must be replaced.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-60\">[60]</a> Liebig nevertheless believed the nitrogen was supplied from the air. The enrichment of soil with guano by the Incas was rediscovered in 1802, by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt\">Alexander von Humboldt</a>. This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-61\">[61]</a></p><p>The work of Liebig was a revolution for agriculture, and so other investigators started experimentation based on it. In England <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bennet_Lawes\">John Bennet Lawes</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry_Gilbert\">Joseph Henry Gilbert</a> worked in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothamsted_Research\">Rothamsted Experimental Station</a>, founded by the former, and (re)discovered that plants took nitrogen from the soil, and that salts needed to be in an available state to be absorbed by plants. Their investigations also produced the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superphosphate\">superphosphate</a>\", consisting in the acid treatment of phosphate rock.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellogg19574-62\">[62]</a> This led to the invention and use of salts of potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) as fertilizers. Ammonia generated by the production of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)\">coke</a> was recovered and used as fertiliser.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-63\">[63]</a> Finally, the chemical basis of nutrients delivered to the soil in manure was understood and in the mid-19th century chemical fertilisers were applied. However, the dynamic interaction of soil and its life forms still awaited discovery.</p><p>In 1856 J. Thomas Way discovered that ammonia contained in fertilisers was transformed into nitrates,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-64\">[64]</a> and twenty years later <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Warington\">Robert Warington</a> proved that this transformation was done by living organisms.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-65\">[65]</a> In 1890 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Winogradsky\">Sergei Winogradsky</a> announced he had found the bacteria responsible for this transformation.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-66\">[66]</a></p><p>It was known that certain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume\">legumes</a> could take up nitrogen from the air and fix it to the soil but it took the development of bacteriology towards the end of the 19th century to lead to an understanding of the role played in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation\">nitrogen fixation</a> by bacteria. The symbiosis of bacteria and leguminous roots, and the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria, were simultaneously discovered by the German agronomist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hellriegel\">Hermann Hellriegel</a> and the Dutch microbiologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinus_Beijerinck\">Martinus Beijerinck</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellogg19574-62\">[62]</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_rotation\">Crop rotation</a>, mechanisation, chemical and natural fertilisers led to a doubling of wheat yields in western Europe between 1800 and 1900.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellogg19571–4-67\">[67]</a></p>', '2019-06-09 07:10:07');
